## Summary
---

I've been looking into differnt ways to boost my productivity. I'm giving 
NeoVim a shot to work on that because I've heard good things about it.

## Clone Repository
---

The repsitory can be cloned using the following command.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/n3s0/n3s0-nvim.git
```

If anyone would like to use this, the following commands will do the trick.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/n3s0/n3s0-nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

There is also the SSH method for me.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:n3s0/n3s0-nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
